* About
This repo is organized to use =GNU Stow=. If you want to make it easy
to use, make sure that the package =stow= is installed.

* Dependencies
I use [[https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell][base16-shell]] to set my shell's default ANSI colors.

To setup =base16-shell= :
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ base16_ # hit tab to complete with the theme that you want
#+END_SRC

* Setup
If you don't know how to use =GNU Stow=, here the basic command :
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ stow FOLDER [FOLDER2 ...]
#+END_SRC
