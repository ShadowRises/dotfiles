* About
This repo is organized to use =GNU Stow=. If you want to make it easy
to use, make sure that the package =stow= is installed.

* Dependencies
To setup my wallpapers I use 2 greate tools:
- [[https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal/][pywal]] -- which create a color scheme from an image
- [[https://github.com/stoeckmann/xwallpaper][xwallpaper]] -- which sets an image as the wallpaper

* Setup
If you don't know how to use =GNU Stow=, here's the basic command:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ stow FOLDER [FOLDER2 ...]
#+END_SRC
